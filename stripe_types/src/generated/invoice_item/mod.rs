/// Invoice Items represent the component lines of an [invoice](https://stripe.com/docs/api/invoices).
///
/// An invoice item is added to an invoice by creating or updating it with an `invoice` field, at which point it will be included as [an invoice line item](https://stripe.com/docs/api/invoices/line_item) within [invoice.lines](https://stripe.com/docs/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-lines).  Invoice Items can be created before you are ready to actually send the invoice.
/// This can be particularly useful when combined with a [subscription](https://stripe.com/docs/api/subscriptions).
/// Sometimes you want to add a charge or credit to a customer, but actually charge or credit the customerâ€™s card only at the end of a regular billing cycle.
/// This is useful for combining several charges (to minimize per-transaction fees), or for having Stripe tabulate your usage-based billing totals.
