Welcome to the **async-stripe** documentation. This library provides strongly-typed, safe, and performant Rust bindings for the Stripe API. It is designed to be modular, allowing you to pull in only the specific Stripe resources you need for your application.

## API Version


The current API version for async-stripe <CurrentVersion /> is:

<CodeFromFile
  file="generated/async-stripe-shared/src/version.rs"
  href={{base: "https://github.com/arlyon/async-stripe/blob/master/"}}
  lang="rust"
  startLine={1}
  endLine={1}
  dedent
/>

This means all API requests will use this version regardless of your Stripe account's default API version. This ensures consistent behavior and prevents breaking changes from affecting your application unexpectedly.

<Callout type="warn" title="Compatibility">
`async-stripe` is pinned to a specific Stripe API version. Each week, we sync against the official APIs and bump our types to match. **It is critically important** that you understand which version you're using, as mismatches between the library version and your expectations can lead to unexpected behavior, missing features, or parsing errors. As a result, you should when possible be regularly updating the both this library, and your Stripe account's api, to the latest available version.

We do not currently have the resources to backport fixes to older APIs.
</Callout>

Any webhooks received that to not match this version will publish a warning via `tracing`.

## Quick Start

Here's a quick example of how to create a new Stripe Customer.

### 1. Add dependencies to your `Cargo.toml`

You'll need the main `async-stripe` crate for the client and a resource crate for the APIs you want to use (e.g., `stripe-core` for customers).

<CodeFromFile
  file="README.md"
  title="Cargo.toml"
  href={{base: "https://github.com/arlyon/async-stripe/blob/master/"}}
  dedent
  startLine={46}
  endLine={49}
/>

### 2. Create a Customer

The new API uses a builder pattern that flows naturally from request creation to sending.

<CodeFromFile
  file="examples/endpoints/src/customer.rs"
  href={{base: "https://github.com/arlyon/async-stripe/blob/master/"}}
  dedent
  startLine={14}
  endLine={20}
/>
