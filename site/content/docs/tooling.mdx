## Development Environment (Mise)

This project uses [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev) (formerly rtx) to manage development tool versions. This ensures that all contributors and CI environments use the exact same version of the Rust toolchain, preventing "it works on my machine" issues related to compiler versions.

### Why Mise?

- **Reproducible Builds**: Pins the exact Rust version defined in `mise.toml`
- **Fast**: Written in Rust, it is significantly faster than alternatives like asdf
- **Seamless Integration**: Automatically switches tool versions when you enter the project directory

## Setup

### 1. Install Mise

Follow the [official installation guide](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html) for your OS.

```bash
# Example (MacOS/Linux)
curl https://mise.run | sh
```

### 2. Install Project Tools

Navigate to the project root and run:

```bash
mise install
```

This will read the `mise.toml` file and install the pinned Rust version.

## Configuration

The tool versions are defined in `mise.toml` at the root of the repository. We strictly pin the Rust version to match our CI environment and `Cargo.toml` rust-version requirements.

```toml
[tools]
# We pin to a specific stable version to ensure consistent behavior
# across all developer machines.
rust = "1.88"
```

## Workflow

Once installed and hooked into your shell, mise automatically activates the correct tool versions when you `cd` into the directory.

### Check active version

```bash
mise current
# Output: rust 1.88
```

### Run a one-off command

If you haven't added the shell hook, you can run commands in the environment explicitly:

```bash
mise exec -- cargo test
```
