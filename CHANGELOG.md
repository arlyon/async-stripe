# Version 0.15.1 (January 16, 2022)

This is a half-release before we overhaul the codegen in 0.16.
I want to give a special shoutout to @mzeitlin11 who has been
doing some excellent work behind the scenes cleaning up the
codegen.

## Features

- add a number of missing ids to `ids.rs`
- add a number of missing prefixes to `ids.rs`
- restore `serde_path_to_error` to give better error messages when
  parsing responses from the API
- add api to retrieve checkout session
- add api to cancel a setup intent

## Fixes

- export the `generated` modules so that overlapping apis can be
  reached by their path
- handle the `idempotency_error` error variant
- allow blocking client to be used in a multithreaded scenario
- disable connection pooling to prevent API errors

# Version 0.15.0 (June 9, 2022)

This release comes with some improvements to list traversal as well
as dramatic expansion of the api surface when dealing with webhooks!

## Features

- BREAKING: list methods now only borrow their parameters
- Add a streaming api for lazily and ergonomically traversing lists
- Exported the stripe terminal APIs
- Significantly more webhook types now available

## Fixes

- List traversals now properly include parameters when fetching
  later list items

# Version 0.14.1 (May 20, 2022)

This release is a minor patch release to fix an oversight in the API.

## Fixes

- Expose the request strategy API

# Version 0.14.0 (March 22, 2022)

This release has been focused on refining the ergonomics
supporting additional stripe APIs, and adding retries / idempotency.

## Features

- BREAKING: fluent client config api.
- Add the `card` param to the codegen. (@erichCompSci)
- Derive `Default` across the codebase.
- Opt-in idempotency functionality. (@erichCompSci)
- Opt-in retry logic.

In addition we have expanded the test coverage, and will
continue to do so with more examples.

# Version 0.13.0 (January 22, 2021)

First release of async-stripe with swappable runtimes.

## Breaking Changes

- You will now need to select a runtime to use the library.
- There may be small breaks in other places in the api.

# Version 0.12.3 (May 16, 2020)

## Fixes

- Fix failing `Invoice::upcoming` by adding a `is_none` representation to InvoiceId (@bryanburgers)

# Version 0.12.2 (May 15, 2020)

## Features

- Enable RustTLS behind a feature flag (@kiljacken)

## Fixes

- Add missing values to `PaymentMethodType` and `PaymentIntentMethodType` (@ThouCheese)

# Version 0.12.1 (February 6, 2020)

## Fixes

- Fixed deserialization of `ChargeId`s with `py_` prefix in `PaymentIntent` event(s).

# Version 0.12.0 (February 3, 2020)

## Breaking Changes

- Updated to a newer version of the Stripe API.
- The `PaymentIntent<___>Params` structs have been renamed to be consistent with the autogenerated API

  > e.g. `PaymentIntentCreateParams` has become `CreatePaymentIntent`

## Features

- The `app-info` header can now be set/customized with the `Client::set_app_info` method.

## Improvements

- New feature flags have been introduced to disable unused parts of the stripe APIs.
  This helps reduce binary bloat and compile time.

- The async client has been updated to use `std::future::Future`.
  The `async` feature flag is deprecated.
  Prefer `{ default-features = false, features = ["full"] }` instead.
- Set default stripe api version to the latest version supported by the library.
  This is intended to avoid bugs where a later version of stripe is enabled by a customer.

## Feature Flags

By default the `full` stripe api is enabled.

To reduce code size, disable default features and enable just the APIs you use:

```toml
# Example: Core-only (enough to create a `Charge` or `Card` or `Customer`)
stripe-rust = { version = "*", default-features = false, features = ["blocking"] }

# Example: Support for "Subscriptions" and "Invoices"
stripe-rust = { version = "*", default-features = false, features = ["blocking", "billing"] }
```

Refer to the [Stripe API docs](https://stripe.com/docs/api) to determine
which APIs are included as part of each feature flag.

# Version 0.11.0 (September 11, 2019)

## Features

- The `stripe-version` header can now be set/customized with the `Client::with_headers` method.

## Improvements

- The `Default` trait is now derived for all structs that have only defaultable parameters.
- `Webhook::construct_event` takes payload, signature, and secret args by ref (`&str`) instead of value.
- The `payment_method` and `confirmation_method` fields were added to `PaymentIntentCreateParams`.
- The `payment_method_details` structure now supports the `card` data field.

## Fixes

- Boolean fields that may be `null`, are now `Option` instead of `serde(default)`.
- The `Customer` variant was added to the `EventObject` enum.
- The `PaymentIntentCaptureParams` are now correctly `pub`.
- Fixed parsing a negative customer `account_balance`.

# Version 0.10.5 (July 25, 2019)

## Breaking Changes

- The `PaymentSourceParams` struct was edit to only include a `TokenId` and `SourceId` as per improvements to the API.

# Version 0.10.4 (July 12, 2019)

## Improvements

- Added `id` field to `Event`

## Fixes

- Fixes a regression deriving `Eq` and `PartialEq` for `PaymentIntent` enums.

# Version 0.10.2 (June 13, 2019)

## Fixes

- Fixed the `InvoiceLineItemId` type to correctly handle subscription items.

# Version 0.10.0 / 0.10.1 (June 4, 2019)

This version uses code generation to generate the stripe API according to the openapi spec.

This contains major breaking changes from previous versions, both
because many structures were out of date and because some changes
were made to make things easier to generate.

## New Features

- Many new APIs have now been implemented (mostly CRUD); some requests are still missing
  because not all requests are automatically implemented. All previously implemented
  requests are still implemented (even if they couldn't be code-generated).

- Many requests now take the `expand` parameter which controls whether more data should
  be returned for `Expandable<T>` fields. Previously these fields were just id types.

## Improvements

- Fields and requests have descriptive documentation rather than just referring to the stripe API docs.
- Ids and fields are more strictly typed (newtypes vs raw strings).
- Ids no longer need to be allocated and are cheaply clonable (in _almost_ all cases).
- Enum types now implement `Display` and `AsRef<str>`.

# Version 0.9.2 (April 7, 2019)

## Fixes / Improvements

- Add missing `product` to `Plan`.
- Add missing `receipt_url` to `Charge`.
- The deprecated `closed` field in `Invoice` is now optional.
- Fix allowing the `description` field in `Payout` to be optional.
- Fix allowing a `SubscriptionItem` quantity to be `None` (e.g. when using metered pricing API).
- Fix signature checking for received Webhooks.
- Allow the timestamp to be manually specified when verifying webhook signature.

# Version 0.9.1 (Feb 4, 2019)

## Fixes

- Detach source data structure is a new `DetachedSource` enum
- The `object` field was removed from `PaymentIntent`, `Refund` and `Payout`.
- Fields in `PaymentIntent` were updated to correctly be optional

# Version 0.9.0 (Jan 17, 2019)

## New Features

- Added an `async` feature flag which removes `stripe::Client` and adds `stripe::async::Client`.

## Breaking Changes

- The `stripe::Params` typed was renamed to `Headers` to avoid confusion
  with other `FooParams` types and the `params` module.

# Version 0.8.0 (Jan 15, 2019)

## New Features

- Added `verify_bank_account` to `Customer` resource.
- Added BankAccount as a variant of `PaymentSource`.
- Add the [PaymentIntents](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/payment-intents) resources, apis and events.

## Breaking Changes

- See also **Fixes / Improvements**.

## Fixes / Improvements

  e.g. `Customer::create`, `Customer::update`, etc.

# Version 0.7.0 and 0.7.1

## Fixes

- The type of `Customer.default_source` has changed from `SourceId` to `PaymentSourceId`.
- The type of `Customer.sources` has changed from `List<Source>` to `List<PaymentSource>`.

# Version 0.6.0

## New Features / Improvements

- The `List<T>` type has new `next` and `get_all` methods for pagination.
- Struct types more consistently implement `Clone`.
- Enum types more consistently implement `Copy`, `Eq`, and `Hash`.
- More source details (e.g. `ach_credit_transfer`, etc) were added to `Source`.
- The blocking api is now backed by `reqwest` instead of `hyper:0.10` so that
  the library is no longer pinned to outdated dependencies.
- Added the "webhooks" feature flag for processing events (enabled by default)
  to convert `hmac` and `sha2` to optional dependencies.

## Breaking Changes

- (Mostly from 0.5.x series) `Charge`, `Card`, and `Source` have been updated
  to use new enum values rather than `String`.
- The `SourceType` enum used by **ChargeListParams** has been renamed to
  `SourceFilterType` to remove a conflict with the `SourceType` enum used by
  the type field of **Source**.

## Fixes

- All `Address` fields have been updated to be optional.
- The `Client-Id` param has been added to params to make support for
  impersonating **Connect Accounts** compatible with newer stripe api versions.

- Source and token fields (like `token: &str`) now use `source: SourceId` or `token: TokenId` instead.

## General Improvements

- Added missing `default_source` field to `Customer`.
- The `Deserialize` and `Serialize` traits have now been implemented for all param and resource structs.
- The `Copy`, `Clone`, `Eq`, `PartialEq`, and `Hash` traits have been derived for flat enum types.
