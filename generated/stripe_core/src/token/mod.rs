/// Tokenization is the process Stripe uses to collect sensitive card or bank
/// account details, or personally identifiable information (PII), directly from
/// your customers in a secure manner.
///
/// A token representing this information is returned to your server to use.
/// Use our [recommended payments integrations](https://stripe.com/docs/payments) to perform this process on the client-side.
/// This guarantees that no sensitive card data touches your server, and allows your integration to operate in a PCI-compliant way.  If you can't use client-side tokenization, you can also create tokens using the API with either your publishable or secret API key.
/// If your integration uses this method, you're responsible for any PCI compliance that it might require, and you must keep your secret API key safe.
/// Unlike with client-side tokenization, your customer's information isn't sent directly to Stripe, so we can't determine how it's handled or stored.  You can't store or use tokens more than once.
/// To store card or bank account information for later use, create [Customer](https://stripe.com/docs/api#customers) objects or [Custom accounts](https://stripe.com/docs/api#external_accounts). [Radar](https://stripe.com/docs/radar), our integrated solution for automatic fraud protection, performs best with integrations that use client-side tokenization.
